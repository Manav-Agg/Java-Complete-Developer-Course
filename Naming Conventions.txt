Java Naming Convention
Adopting the accepted conventions for naming variables, methods and objects in java makes your code easier for others to read.
"Others" here also includes you when you coome to look at your code weeks of months after you wrote it.

Packages
the things you will name in java are:
1. Packages
2. Classes
3. Interfaces
4. Methods
5. Constants
6. Variables
7. Type Parameters

Packages
Always lower case.
Package names should be unique.
Use your internet domain name, reversed, as a prefix for the package name.

Invalid domain name components
Replace invalid characters(i.e. -) in domain name with an underscore
Domain name components starting with a number should instead start with an underscore_
Domain name components that are java keywords should have that component start with an underscore.

Examples with replacements
Switch.supplier.com --> com.supplier._switch
1world.com --> com._1world
Experts-exchange.com --> com.experts_exchange

Example package names
java.lang
java.io
org.xml.sax.helpers
com.manav.autoboxing

Class names
CamelCase
Class names should be nouns (they represent things)
Should start with a capital letter
Each word in the name should also start with a capital (e.g. LinkedList, ArrayList, String, TopSong, GearBox, Main)

Interface names
Capitalized like class names (CamelCase).
Consider what objects implementing the interface will become of what they will be able to do
Examples:	List, Comparable, Serializeable

Method names
mixedCase.
Often Verbs.
Reflect the function performed or the result returned.
Examples:	size(), getName(), addPlayer()

Constants
All UPPER_CASE.
Separate words with underscore_.
Declared using the final keyword.
Examples:	Static final int MAX_INT, Static final short SEVERITY_ERROR, Static final double P1 = 3.141592653

Variable names
mixedCase
Meaningful and indicative.
Start with lower case letter
Do not use underscores_
Exmples:	i, league, SydneySwans, BoxLength

Type Parameter
Single Character, capital letters
Examples:	E - Element (used extensively by the Java Collections Framework; K - Key; T - Type; V - Value; S,U,V, etc. - 2nd, 3rd, 4th types
