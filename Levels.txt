Top Level
Only Classes, interfaces and enums can exist at the top level, everything else must be included within one of these.
public: The object is visible to all classes everywhere, whether they are in the same package or have imported the package containing the public class.
Package-private: The object is only available within its own package (and is visible to every class within the same package). Package-private is specified by not specifying, i.e. it is the default if you do not specify public. There is not a "package-private" keyword.

Member Level
public: At the member level, public has the same meaning as at top level. A public class member (or field) and public method can be accessed from any other class anywhere, even in a different package.
Package-private: This also has the same meaning as it does at the top level. An object with no accesss modifier is visible toevery class within the same package (but not to classes in external packages).
private: The object is only visible within the class it is declared. It is not visible anywhere else (including in subclasses of its class).
protected: The object is visible anywhere in its own package (like package-private) but also in subclasses even if they are in another package.
