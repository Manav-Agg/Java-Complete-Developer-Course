Packages
Over 9 million Java developers worldwide
Class or Interface name conflicts are inevitable
Mechanism is needed to fully specify class
Allow use of classes with the same name in the same project (or, even, the same class)

Some reasons to use packages are:
Programmers can easily determine that the classes are related.
It is easy to know where to find the classes and interfaces tha can provide the functions provided by the packages.
Because the package creates a new namespace, class and interface name conflicts are avoided.
Classes within the package can have unrestricted access to one another while still restricting access for classes outside the package.
